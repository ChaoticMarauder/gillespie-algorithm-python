    "## Part 1. Characterisation of stochastic mathematical models of the time behaviour of  spatially homogenous chemical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The *stochastic approach* or framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The time evolution is regarded as a kind of random-walk process. (A *deterministic model*, in contrast, regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process.)\n",
    "2. The time evolution of the system is governed by a single differential-difference equation called the “master equation” or is computationally calculated exactly by the Gillespie algorithm. (In a *deterministic model*, the time evolution of the system is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations called the “reaction-rate equations”.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning behind the stochastic framework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The time evolution of a chemically reacting system is not a continuous process, because molecular population levels obviously can change only by discrete integer amounts. \n",
    "2. The time evolution is not a deterministic process, for, the molecular motions are regarded to be governed by the equations of classical mechanics, it is impossible to predict the exact molecular population levels at some future time, unless we take account of the precise positions and velocities of all the molecules in the system. In other words, although the temporal behavior of a chemically reacting system of classical molecules is a deterministic process in the full position-momentum phase space of the system, it is not a deterministic process in the N-dimensional subspace of the species population numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification of stochastic models as mathematical models\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The stochastic model is linear (not nonlinear)** - because chemical reactions exihibit linear relationships between the reactants. For example, an enzymatic reaction \n",
    "    \n",
    "    S + E <-> SE -> E + P\n",
    "    \n",
    "is broken down into\n",
    "\n",
    "    S + E -> SE\n",
    "    SE -> S + E\n",
    "    SE -> E + P\n",
    "    \n",
    "which all have linear relations between the reactants and products. Note that a linear model does not necessarily predic non-linear expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stochastic models are dynamic (not static i.e. time-invariant)** -  because they accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system. (A *static model* calculates the system in equillibrium. An example is Flux Balance Analysis of metabolic models using linear programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stochastic models are explicit** -  all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stochastic models are discrete** - objects are treated as discrete entities. (A *continuous model* represents the objects in a continuous manner, for example, chemical reactions can be regarded as a continuous rate processes e.g. 1/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stochastic models are probabilistic and not deterministic** - randomness is included in the model in order to capture inherent fluctuations in the molecular population levels. Therefore variable states are described by probability distributions and these models can perform differently for the same set of initial conditions. (A deterministic model is one where the variable states are uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables. Therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions.)"

    "\n",
    "### The problem we want to solve\n",
    "\n",
    "The system:\n",
    "\n",
    "M chemical reactions `R1, ... ,RM` that involve `N` chemical species `S1, ..., SN`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given `X1, ..., XN` number of particles for each of the species, at some initial time, what will these molecular population levels be at a later time?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling the system stochastically - Translating of the problem into stochastic language \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions of the stochastic framework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A fixed volume `V` \n",
    "2. `V` contains a spatially uniform mixture of `N` chemical species\n",
    "3. The chemical species are in thermal (but not necessarily chemical) equilibrium, which means that collisions occur in an essentially random manner.\n",
    "3. A chemical reaction occurs whenever two or more molecules of \"appropriate kinds\" (defined by the reaction equations) collide in an \"appropriate way\" (assuming that the two molecules `S1` and `S2` are hard spheres of radii `rl` and `r2`, a collision will occur between them whenever the center-to-center distance between the two molecules decreases to `r12= r1 + r2`). \n",
    "4. All collisions are reactive, i.e. they result in chemical alterations of the colliding molecules as defined by the reaction equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A simple chamical system modelled stochastically is characterised by a \"collision/reaction probability per unit time\" (i.e. it is a stochastic Markov process) and not by a \"collision rate\" (i.e. a deterministic rate process)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have two molecules `S1` and `S2`. Whilst we cannot rigorously calculate *the number of collisions* between `S1` and `S2`, occurring in `V` in any infinitesimal time interval, we can rigorously calculate *the probability of a collision* occurring between `S1` and `S2`, in `V` in any infinitesimal time interval (shown below).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side note:** A stochastic Markov process is one that satisfies the so called *Markov property*, which says that the conditional probability distribution of future states of a process depends only upon the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. (Compare this with the deterministic framework which assumes that the any future state of the system is determined by previous states and specifically the initial state of the system.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the propensity of each reaction (the collision/reaction probability per unit time)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with an **example**. Suppose the `S1` and `S2` molecules in `V` can undergo the reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "R1: S1 + S2 -> 2S1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we may assert the existence of a constant `cl`, which depends only on the physical properties of the two molecules and the temperature of the system, such that `c1*dt` is *the average probability that a particular `S1-S2` molecular pair will react according to `R1` in the next infinitesimal time interval `dt`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that, if at time `t` there are `X1` of the `S1` molecules and `X2` of the `S2` molecules, making a total of `h1 = Xl*X2` distinct `S1-S2` pairs. Let `a1=h1*c1` then `a1*dt` is *the probability that an `R1` reaction will occur somewhere inside `V` in the next infinitesimal time interval `(t, t + dt)`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"diag.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take another example. Consider the reverse of the reaction of `R1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "R2: 2S1 -> S1 + S2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we would characterize this reaction by a constant `c2`, such that `c2*dt` is the average probability that a particular pair of `S1` molecules will react according to `R2` in the next `dt`. However, the number of distinct pairs of `S1` molecules in `V` is not `X1*X1` but `h2 = X1*(X1-1)/2!`. . Let `a2=h2*c2`. Hence, the probability that an `R2` reaction will occur somewhere inside `V` in the next time interval `dt` is `a2*dt`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for the **general form**, suppose the volume `V` contains a mixture of `Xj` molecules of chemical species `Sj (j = 1, ..., N)` and suppose further that these `N` species can interreact through `M` specified chemical reaction channels `Ri (i = 1, ..., M)`. Then we may assert the existence of `M` constants `ci (i =  1, ..., M)`, which depend only on the physical properties of the molecules and the temperature of the system, such that `ci*dt` is the *the average probability that a particular combination of `Ri` reactant molecules will react accordingly in the next infinitesimal time interval dt*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let `hi` be the total number of distinct combinations of `R_i` reactant molecules in `V` at time `t` (a simple algebraic expression calculated using the binomial coefficient of the stoichiometry of the reactants). Then, if we multiply `ci*dt` by `hi`, we will obtain the probability `ai*dt` (where `ai=hi*ci`) that an `Ri` reaction will occur somewhere inside `V` in the next infinitesimal time interval `(t, t + dt)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary**:\n",
    "- *the propensity of a reaction* `Ri (i = 1, ..., M)` is governed solely by the fundamental hypothesis that, for  constants `ci`, which depends only on the physical properties of the reactants of `Ri`, `ci*dt` is *the average probability that the particular combination of `Ri` reactant molecules will react in the next infinitesimal time interval dt*. \n",
    "- furthermore, the probability of reaction `Ri` happening in the next time interval `(t, t + dt)` is calculated as the product `hi` of the total number of distinct combinations of `Ri` reactant molecules and `ci*dt`, i.e. `ai*dt` for `ai=hi*ci`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the time evolution of the system (that is modelled stochastically)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider how to sample the time evolution of this system in a way that it follows the probability density function of the Chemical Master Equation. Remember that the system is a Markov process, so it is enough to base the argument on the current state of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are given that the system is in the state `(X1,...,XN)` at time `t`,  essentially all we need in order to “move the system forward in time” is to answer these two questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. when will the next reaction occur, and \n",
    "2. what kind of reaction will it be \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to obtain the next time `T` and reaction `mu`, could be to draw two random numbers `r1` and `r2` from the normal distribution and to use them to calculate the next time and reaction by:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"c2.png\" style=\"width: 180px;\"/>\n",

    "<img src=\"a0.png\" style=\"width: 350px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"a.png\" style=\"width: 100px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that this relies on the propensities of the reactions that we calculated just above.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is shown in Gillespie's paper that choosing the next time and reaction in this way, samples directly from the *probability density function* that is the Chemical Master Equation. (Note that this probability density function is a joint probability density function (also knows as a probability measure) of the continuous variable T (0<= T < inf), for the time of the next reaction, and the discrete variable (mu = 1, 2,. ..,M).)\n",
